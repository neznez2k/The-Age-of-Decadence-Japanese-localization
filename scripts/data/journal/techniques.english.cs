$techText = $ttHeader @ "Metalworking<spop> - you've learned how to work with metals and are able to forge weapons and armor.<br><br>" @ $ttHeader @ "Masterwork<spop> - you've acquired the secret ratios and temperatures necessary to forge harder and stronger metals and thus are able to forge high quality weapons and armor.<br><br>" @ $ttHeader @ "Hardened Edge<spop> - you've learned how to heat treat and edge quench different metals to harden them without making them brittle. Weapons that receive this treatment have superior armor damage.<br><br>" @ $ttHeader @ "Balanced<spop> - you've learned the long forgotten secrets of blade geometries divined by the Magi in the olden days. Weapons forged with this knowledge are much easier to wield, which increases the accuracy.<br><br>" @ $ttHeader @ "Serrated Edge<spop> - you've learned how to add serrations to your weapons to aid in ripping and tearing through non-metal materials. Serrations increase your chance to cause a critical hit.<br><br>" @ $ttHeader @ "Hardened Armor<spop> - you've learned how to heat treat and full quench different metals to harden them without making them brittle. Hardened armor is more resistant to damage.<br><br>" @ $ttHeader @ "Lightened Armor<spop> - you've learned how to make armor less restrictive in combat without sacrificing its defensive qualities.<br><br>" @ $ttHeader @ "Reinforced Armor<spop> - you've learned how to reinforce armor's weak spots and joints to protect its wearer against critical strikes without sacrificing mobility.<br><br>" @ $ttHeader @ "Flexible Bow<spop> - you've learned one of the ancient Ordu spirit rituals. It requires blood, tendons, and animal glue, and if performed correctly, will bind the spirits to a bow, making it snap back into position when shot, increasing the accuracy.<br><br>" @ $ttHeader @ "Mechanical Crossbow<spop> - you've learned a carefully guarded secret of Medean artificers: a clever crank which can easily fit inside the stock and make reloading a crossbow a less complicated affair, which increases the accuracy.<br><br>" @ $ttHeader @ "***<spop><br><br>" @ $ttHeader @ "Healing<spop> - you've learned how to make healing pastes and ointments.<br><br>" @ $ttHeader @ "Poison<spop> - you've learned how to extract poison from plants and make effective antidotes.<br><br>" @ $ttHeader @ "Battle Rage<spop> - you've learned the secrets of the Scanian berserkers and can now brew rage-inducing and damage-resistant potions.<br><br>" @ $ttHeader @ "Acid<spop> - you've learned how to make acids from sulphur and modify its properties with other reagents.<br><br>" @ $ttHeader @ "Rapid Cellular Regeneration<spop> - you aren't really sure what it means, but \'regeneration\' sounds promising. According to the scroll, the elixir was developed during the Great War and was given to special regiments, so what was good for them should be good for you. Unfortunately, the scroll makes frequent references to unfamiliar alchemical practices, so you'll have to rely on guesswork a lot.<br><br>" @ $ttHeader @ "Neurostimulant<spop> - you've managed to decipher the neurostimulant formula. One of the stages requires molecular transfusion, so you'll keep an eye out for it, but even without it you can distil elixirs that significantly speed up your movement and reaction time.<br><br>" @ $ttHeader @ "Liquid Fire<spop> - you've learned the secrets of liquid fire that was used with great effect in naval warfare. You won't be able to burn fleets, but you know enough to produce a small quantity of it and throw it at your enemies.<br><br>" @ $ttHeader @ "Black Powder Bomb<spop> - you've learned how to make crude bombs in clay pots and handle them safely.";
