Now the extent of its domain is a single, crumbling town, Teron. Though to all appearances House Daratan has already been lowered into the grave, someone is gathering resources for one last fight, to either restore the Noble House to glory, or condemn it into oblivion for good.");

Returning to the rubble and chaos with fresh men and a clear, cold vision, Lord Gaelius I, first of his line, moved swiftly to take control of every town and fort with any strategic value. Today House Aurelian rules Maadoran, the largest city, making every effort to ensure their legacy will be a long one. As the most powerful faction, their prestige is naturally resented by the lesser Houses.");

Consequently, they were instrumental in both conducting the Great Ritual and assembling the wondrous machines that made it possible. Most of the Magi perished in the last days of the conflict, depriving House Crassus not only of generations of wisdom and research, but of their very purpose. Today House Crassus has fallen back on religion, calling for proper worship and the restoration of the gods as the natural rulers of men.");

While the Noble Houses squabble and stab at one another, struggling over any advantage, the Guards\' goals are more idealistic. They wish to restore the Empire to its former glory, no matter how far it has fallen.");

The guild traces its origin to the early days of the Empire, when the kingpins of the forty largest towns were said to form a council overseeing all illegal activity. Whatever the relationship, if any, between the Forty Thieves of yore and its current incarnation, the name persists.");

Many opponents meeting misfortune in the dead of night were said to be victims of their long reaching hand. After the Fall, the guard knew no master, but they found that even in a world of ruins their peacekeeping services were in demand. Rather than disband into the chaos, the former royal guard established an order of assassins, affectionately named for their old regiment.");
