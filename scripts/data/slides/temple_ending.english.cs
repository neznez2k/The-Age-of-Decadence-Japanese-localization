His detractors put his string of victories down to extraordinary luck or witchcraft, but his allies are quick to remark that what matters is who wins, not how it is done. Besides, they will smugly add, it was always prophesied that Antidas would restore his House to its rightful place.\n\nDespite Antidas\' uncanny luck, the war is long and three bloody years will pass before he is able to proclaim the birth of a new Empire over the corpses of his foes.\n\nThe new king proves as adept at statecraft as slaughter, but his ambition is not satisfied with rule according to the Empire\'s ancient borders. Next he looks to pacifying the wasteland and conquering far away kingdoms. Rumors speak of a power behind the throne, an adviser trusted above all others, for Antidas takes no decision without consulting this mystery figure. Loose tongues (or perhaps merely jealous ones) claim that Antidas himself is nothing but a puppet and this shadowy Other the true ruler, but only a fool would credit such stories.";

Soldiers whisper of divine intervention which they take as a sign that the Gods are on their side.\n\nStrangely enough, Gaelius becomes more spiritual after the conquest and builds a grand temple dedicated to Agathoth, the patron God of Regnum Aureum. In fact, Gaelius\' own vizier is said to be a devotee of Agathoth and, if rumors are to be believed, a practitioner of dark arts, which would certainly explains Gaelius\' unchanging luck.";

Surprisingly, the call is answered; sellswords, soldiers, and even raiders abandon their former occupation without a second thought and come in droves under the Crassus\' banner.\n\nMeru leads his new army himself, conjuring miracles and striking fear of God into the hearts of his enemies. Armies opposing him suffer from plagues and desertion. Entire legions switch sides, kneeling to Meru and boosting his ranks until nothing can stand in his way.\n\nThus the era of warring city-states has finally come to an end, and for the first time in history a kingdom of God reign supreme over the land. His destiny fulfilled, Meru returns to his sermons, leaving the day-to-day duties of running the kingdom in the hands of the new prophet, a holy <man/woman> favored by the Gods and blessed with many gifts.";

It seems an act of pure madness at first for Paullus isn\'t a noble born and would never be accepted by the nobles, even if his men do conquer all.\n\nYet as if by magic, the lesser nobles throw their support with Paullus, demanding a new government and even starting riots. One by one the cities, sabotaged from within, open their gates to the Imperial Guards.\n\nDictator Paullus rules the land with an iron fist, as if it were a military camp. Every town, settlement, and district is assigned to an officer, according to rank. Every citizen is given orders, according to the social status. The punishment is always the same - slave labor, regardless of rank and status.\n\nThe only exception is Paullus\' personal adviser, a <man/woman> who said to be instrumental in securing the nobles\' support and organizing riots. They say <he/she> is a holy <man/woman> who answers to a higher power and that even Paullus speaks with <him/her> with the utmost respect and seeks <his/her> counsel and always finds <his/her> advice worth following.";

In fact, that\'s your next task - to gather an army and wage a war to wipe the canvas clean. You obey and give a speech, not expecting much, yet once again, something rises within you, imbuing your words with suggestive power that will linger for days, compelling people to take up arms and answer your call.\n\nYou become the God\'s eyes and ears. Through you he directs his army. Through you he works his miracles and rules his growing domain. You have your liberties and your own decisions as the God is only interested in broad strokes, leaving the details to you, but at the end of the day you\'re more of a slave than the lowliest of your subjects.";

Cresting the final rise above the valley, they discover not a long abandoned tomb but a buzzing hive of activity. Thousands of thralls - desert nomads, travelers, raiders and peasants - toil there, compelled by the demigod. They appear to be shifting debris and building new walls and structures. Some are even clearing land, perhaps for farming. But even as the soldiers watch, mouths agape, every man woman and child below drop their tasks and form perfect ranks before the ziggurat.\n\nPaullus realizes he must take action at once, and his voice cracks as he orders everyone to raise arms and charge, but already too late. Before they\'ve taken but a few strides, the men stumble to a ragged halt. Like wind on a field of grain, a kind of horror sweeps through the ranks.\n\nSome soldiers fall to the ground, weeping uncontrollably, others drop their weapons and shields and stand in place, eyes vacant and arms limp, and the rest turn on their own, hacking madly at anyone within reach.\n\nThat is when the thralls attack. They are untrained and few have any sort of weapon, favoring pieces of masonry, broken timber, or failing that bare hands. But they fight without fear and move in broad, coordinated patterns, more like insects swarming than disciplined troops.";

While the fact of Miltiades\' divine favor is beyond doubt, *why* the Gods have chosen a man missing so many of the attributes of a religious leader - piety, humility, dignity - is a holy mystery that scholars will struggle to unravel for a very long time.\n\nWielding the Gods\' favor like an oversized club, generously studded with spikes, His Most Radiant Holiness Miltiades the First, Glory of a Thousand Suns, expands the authority of the Creed like a street thug driving the competition from his block in the slums. Possessed of an uncanny instinct for weakness, baffling to both his advisors and enemies, the High Priest knows exactly when and where to strike to get exactly what he - what the Gods desire.\n\nIn less than a year the era of warring city-states has come to an end, and the Kingdom of God has begun, ruled by its High Priest with equal measures of jovial charisma and terrifying omniscience.\n\nMiltiades rebuilds the palace to even greater size and glory, all but crowding the other districts from Ganezzar\'s plateau. That throne of splendor becomes a place of pilgrimage where citizens of all sorts - from military men and fat merchants to penniless philosophers and comely virgins - pay tribute, its lofty spires the ultimate proof of the High Priest\'s righteousness, of a man who serves the Gods so thoroughly and so well.";
