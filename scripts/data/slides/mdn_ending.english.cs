Word of his failed gambit spreads, his political opponents painting him as a warmonger and madman whose ambitions would have doomed the city if not for the ever-vigilant Imperial Guards. House Aurelian\'s support wanes amongst the nobility, as does its influence in the region.\n\nSensing vulnerability, House Aurelian\'s enemies work tirelessly to stir discontent and rebellion throughout the city, forcing Gaelius to turn his attention to dealing with the internal threat. Under the pretence of rooting out rebellion, the Boatmen sweep through the city, purging nobles and influential commoners in the hundreds.\n\nReluctantly, Lord Gaelius dons the mantle of tyrant, determined to keep Maadoran at any cost.";

But, contrary to expectations, the Ordu don\'t run amok through the streets, raping and murdering. Instead, they set up their tents around the palace, forming a circle no one dares breach. All attempts at negotiation are refused, the Ordu declaring that they only take orders from Great Khan Gaelius.\n\nAnnouncing that he no longer requires the Imperial Guards\' protection, Gaelius dismisses the local garrison, giving them a week to leave Maadoran. Known for choosing his battles carefully, Dux Paullus complies; his troops leave the city without resistance, marching in silence, while the commoners pelt them with offal and spit curses at them as they go. The fact that the Guards failed to do their duty and keep the savages from their borders has not gone unnoticed, raising questions about the Guards\' ability to defend the border and their allies.\n\nGaelius\' ploy secures his absolute authority in Maadoran, the Ordu becoming his insurance against challenge.

Feeble and ineffectual, this new rule-by-committee proves very agreeable to the other Great Houses.\n\nHouse Aurelian\'s power bleeds away in a slow but steady trickle to the lesser Houses and guilds.
