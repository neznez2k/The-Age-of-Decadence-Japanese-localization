Of course, it wasn\'t the smartest thing to do, but it was a good fight. Nothing makes you feel more alive than killing others, the more the merrier. The harder they come at you, the better.\n\nMore guards show up, at least a dozen. They hesitate and you laugh. Fucking cowards. Three men step forward - no eagerness in their eyes, only fear. They die fast, doomed by it. A self-fulfilling prophecy, if there ever was one.\n\nA crossbow bolt hits you, then another. If they think that it\'s enough to keep you down, they have another think coming. You charge forward, killing two more before some bastard chops your arm off at the elbow. Good thing you\'re ambidextrous - never know when it might come in handy. Good thing for you, bad thing for the man next to you.\n\nYou leave him with your dagger in his throat - something to remember you by - grab a sword off the ground and switch your attention to the next victim. You have a feeling that it\'s going to be the last one, so you put your best foot forward and do what you do best. The sword breaks and you throw it away. Now you\'re ready...";
