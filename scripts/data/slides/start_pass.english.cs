Great warriors, each worth a hundred of the wasteland scum, were tasked to ensure the safety of the southern cities. Time and time again, they held the pass against those who would destroy us. Travellers bold enough to brave the dangers spoke of towers almost touching the clouds, picturesque views, and the horrors of the wasteland.\n\nAs usual, the reality proved to be far less glamorous. The pass is nothing but a wide ledge on the side of the mountain. Two walls blocked the ledge, forming a makeshift fort, housing two small buildings - a place to sleep and a place to eat? - and two old, weather-beaten, wooden towers threatening to fall apart at any moment.\n\nThe \"great warriors\" look more like the very cutthroats they are supposed to defend travellers against than military men. They are well armed. Perhaps, too well, so you wouldn\'t be surprised to learn that they do a bit of raiding on the side.";
