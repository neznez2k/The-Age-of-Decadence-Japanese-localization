They later revisited the site with wise men and tools for breaking rock. With no idea how to open the door itself, the desert folk chiseled through the stone jamb and inside.\n\nA great treasure of ancient weapons, magic charms, and precious metals awaited them. While looting the complex another hidden door, this one in the floor, was revealed quite by accident. It accessed the lower levels. The shaman decreed that the great treasure was a ruse, a distraction to placate fools. As their tribe was clearly not comprised of fools, it only made sense to send a scouting party to explore further.\n\nThe scouts descended into the blackness and the others waited.";

He gathered the strongest among the tribe to form a war party. They prayed and fasted through a long night, making shallow cuts in their flesh, as was the custom, and smearing red clay on their faces. At dawn the war party descended with the shaman\'s strongest blessings.\n\nThe war party did not return.";

The name designated both the three bright red wounds of three stakes in flesh, and the number of sunrises he who was offered could expect to see before enjoying the merciful embrace of death.
