You try to say something, but almost choke on the blood and pass out.\n\nLater on the slaves pick up your body and drag it to the dump. You\'re still alive when they throw your body into a large pile of rotting corpses and waste - your final resting place. The smell is nauseating. You start praying for a merciful death, but the gods are busy and you have to wait for hours until your wish is granted.";
         text1 = "One of the thugs runs you through with his blade and just like that, it\'s over. Your hopes and dreams fade away, leaving you dying on the cold stones over nothing.\n\nThe promise of easy money... some shady deal in the middle of the night... You wonder if it could have ended any other way, but death claims you before you reach any conclusions.";
         text10 = "It happened all too quickly. You said your words and Antidas shouted his orders. His men rushed at your group from every direction and for a brief moment, it looked like you had a chance. It seemed as if only a second had passed before you were on the floor, bleeding like a pig, while your brethren fought - and died, one by one.\n\nYour head was chopped off and sent to Carrinas as a gift. He didn\'t spend any time grieving, immediately ordering an attack in retaliation for the merciless slaughter of his peaceful delegation. Amidst the chaos, your head never had an opportunity to receive the honours it undoubtedly deserved and was thrown out with the rest of the garbage. \n";
         text11 = "Deals that are too good to be true usually aren\'t. Nevertheless, deep down inside you wanted to believe. People get lucky all the time and get something for nothing. Why couldn\'t you be one of them?\n\nThe way you saw it, the universe owed you and it was about time it paid you - with interest. So, instead of doing the smart thing, you followed the trader like a lamb to its slaughter and got yourself killed over what little you had. The universe remained indifferent.\n";
         text12 = "You thought that you were a hero, feeling mighty good about yourself. Of course, that was until you discovered that you had been taken for a fool. Then you let your anger consume you and tell you all kinds of unhelpful things - that was your first mistake. You listened to the anger in your heart when it said \"nobody fucks with you\", which was definitely a lie. You listened again, when it said \"you\'re gonna go and get your money back\", which is what ultimately got you killed.\n\nYou stormed into the hideout. Your righteous anger failed to kill the thieves or produce any noticeable effect, as you were promptly surrounded and hacked to pieces - all over a hundred coins. Your final mistake.\n";
         text13 = "You couldn\'t believe it. Judging by the look on the squatter\'s face, neither could he. Grinning, he lets go of the knife and leaves it in your chest, as he gives you a push. You stumble and fall backwards, landing into the dirt and refuse, as your blood pours over it. \n\nThe squatters laugh. One of them bends down and severs your tendons with fast, experienced motions. You glance at the skeletons. Your fate becomes crystal clear. The squatters leave and the rats slowly emerge from the holes.\n";
         text14 = "You got a bit carried away there. Instead of working Mercato, you decided to put a little bit of pressure on Cado. One thing led to another and you openly threatened the bastard.\n\nAt that moment, you felt the power of your guild surging through you. It encouraged you to be bold, to impose your will - the will of the Commercium - on others, regardless of rank. Who would dare to defy you, and by association, the Commercium? Who would be enough of a fool to lay a hand on you?\n\nYou twitch on the floor of the tavern as your heart pumps more blood out of the wounds. You die in the most undignified way. Your body is dragged to a nearby hole, presumably prepared in advance for such occasions, and you are promptly buried. \n";
         text15 = "You knew that trying to get proof from Carrinas himself would get you killed, but what choice did you have? Linos would have thrown you out and then what? Beg in front of your own guild? Acquire a taste for rat meat and join the squatters as you slowly transformed into one of them? \n\nThat wasn\'t an option for you. So you gambled with your life and lost. Carrinas saw through your bullshit, called his men, and that was it. That was the end of the line for you. An ignoble end to a promising career. The first stab hurt like hell. The second, you barely felt. It was as if someone else was being hacked to pieces, not you. You closed your eyes and drifted away. \n";
         text16 = "One of Mercato\'s men raises his sword to finish you off. The man next to him says something, but you can\'t hear it. He gestures to the ground and steps back. Judging by their expressions, you know what\'s coming next - bloodworms. \n\nWarped by the magic unleashed during the War, bloodworms have doubled in size, growing bold enough to attack wounded men and animals, feeding on blood and tissue fluids. You feel them coming, but you\'re too weak to do anything about it. The first worm reaches you and begins to burrow into one of your wounds. You writhe and scream in pain, as another reaches you. You beg for the men to give you a clean death. Captivated by the feeding worms, the horrified men pay little attention to your screams for mercy.  \n";

You take one sword thrust, then another, stumbling while getting slashed. Then it\'s over, as you fall down dead. \n\nThey leave your body in the tavern as a gift for Cado, but he never returns there. By the time squatters discover that Cado\'s no longer operating out of the tavern, your body has been decomposed beyond recognition. Linos framed the document you signed - dyed red by your blood - displaying it in his office as a warning to others. \n";

No panic or chaos on their side of the fight - they identified and decimated the threat without hesitation. Every sestertius the Commercium was paying them was worth it. \n\nYour newfound respect for the Commercium wasn\'t worth much, considering it was a dead man\'s respect. The mercenaries nail the bodies to makeshift crosses, add a vulgar sign, and continue on their way. \n";

In fact, you\'re surprised you made it that far.\n\nNeither your body, nor the gold was ever found. Some thought that you managed to escape; now living a life of luxury in Maadoran under a new name. Some suspected the truth and waited for your remains to turn up somewhere.\n";
         text2 = "You had to be a hero... The assassin was about to walk away, but you had to stop him. Had to show him that he can\'t pull this shit with you...\n\nThe assassin left you lying in a pool of your own blood, life slowly leaving your body. The dead trader seems oddly indifferent to your sacrifice.";
         text20 = "The raiders finally stop and step away. By some miracle, you\'re still alive. With ribs protruding out of the wounds in your body that\'s been hacked to pieces, you\'re somehow still breathing, albeit not for long. What possessed you to attack them? The first thought in your head is that you really need to lay off the hashish. Your heart runs out of blood to pump and then there are no thoughts in your head. \n\nRealizing that they aren\'t getting any money, the raiders have some sport with the hostage, making him fight until he bleeds out. When Dellar\'s men surround and enter the camp, they find nothing, save for the hacked up remains of two bodies. \n";
         text21 = "Getting into a fight with the Aurelian legionaries was a mistake, but what\'s done is done. Reflecting upon it, you realize that you could have done a number of things instead of storming the outpost all by yourself. Unfortunately, it\'s too late for any of those ideas because you can\'t feel your legs and your left arm is almost severed at the elbow. Even if you live, which is highly unlikely, you will soon wish you didn\'t. \n\nLuckily for you, the Aurelians spare you the humiliation of spending the rest of your days as a cripple. Nailing you to the palisade, they engage in a shooting competition. Whoever puts a bolt through your eye gets the contents of your pockets. The motherfuckers can\'t shoot worth shit, so the ordeal takes a while.\n";
         text22 = "When Hamza came alone, you thought that it was going to be easy. You\'ve been through a lot worse and lived. How hard could one old man be? Now you\'re lying on the cold floor, feeling strangely detached as your life leaks away from you.\n\nStrabos\' pleading stops mid-sentence, then his body hits the floor. Finally, some peace and quiet... You close your eyes, then open them to find Hamza standing over you. His expression is neutral. \"I can make it quick,\" he says, waiting for a response.\n\nHope truly dies last. What if I make it? You try to say something, but you can\'t. You try to raise your arm, but you can\'t do that either and you\'re pretty sure that you can\'t feel your legs. You mouth \"Yes\", hoping that Hamza can understand you, close your eyes and wait for the final mercy.";
         text23 = "You fall down, gasping for air. Belgutai smirks, spits, and goes back to his tent. The smug bastard doesn\'t even celebrate his victory as if it means nothing to him. Fucking savage. Too dumb to realize that he just killed the greatest warrior who\'s ever lived. Well, maybe not the greatest, but top five for sure. If only he knew how many people you killed, he\'d definitely show you more respect. Maybe even have the decency to kill himself.\n\nSomeone throws a stone at you. Fantastic! Just when you thought that this day couldn\'t get any better... The third stone knocks you out. You never wake up.";
         text24 = "In hindsight, you knew that it could only end this way. Of course, you did the best you could and all that, but when you\'re dying, things seem very black and white. You either die here, wondering if all the better places to die were taken, or you go on living, at least until the next call for battle. Sadly, your name\'s on the first list.\n\nThe battle still rages on around you. Men kill and die. Well, the Ordu seem to be doing most of the killing. The pass belongs to them now. Not that you give a fuck at this stage. You take your last breath and leave this world behind.";
         text25 = "You die fighting some scum in the infamous slums of Maadoran. You\'d say it\'s not the death you\'ve always dreamt of, but truth to be told, you didn\'t give your death much thought. Maybe that\'s why you ended up here, dying over nothing in a fight with some thugs whose names you didn\'t even know.";
         text26 = "You should have known better. If Lorenza was easy to kill, she would have been dead a long time ago. Black widow indeed, poison and all. Never thought it could hurt so much. It feels as if someone\'s cutting every nerve in your body with a white-hot blade, searing them an inch at a time. You\'d scream if you could, but your vocal cords are paralyzed.\n\nShe watches you die, probably enjoying it. If only you could kill her with your eyes, gods know you tried. Your chest tightens - the poison has finally reached your heart. Such a relief...\n\nYou die with a smile on your face.\n";
         text27 = "You almost had her. Then again, graveyards are full of people who almost had someone and got an unmarked grave for the effort. Not much of a prize, that\'s for damn sure.\n\n\"Why did you do it?\" she asks. Why indeed. Seemed like a good idea at the time, when you thought that you had a chance. Of course, now that you\'re bleeding to death, you clearly see the errors of your ways and the flaws in your critical thinking, but it\'s not doing much good to you right now. If anything, you\'d rather die thinking that you were not, in fact, an idiot, but that\'s life to you. A bitch to the very end.";
         text28 = "Serenas\' guards were good. Not as good as you, but they didn\'t have to be, when it\'s two against one. You did well. Left behind enough bodies - your legacy remaining for those who\'ll come after you, asking about the great assassins of yesteryear. Your name will surely be mentioned. Carrinas, Lorenza - they weren\'t some nobodies. They can\'t talk about them without mentioning you, can they? Of course, you hoped to add more names to that list, but many people died having a lot less than that to show for it.";

         text3 = "Killed by a fucking oaf for hire... It would be almost funny, if you weren\'t almost dead. The boys at the guild will have something to laugh about, that\'s for sure.\n\nYou knew that you weren\'t going to live forever. The Boatmen rarely die of old age, surrounded by teary-eyed grandchildren. They die on the job, but dying in an uneven fight against well trained guards in some palace, a fight that will never be forgotten, is one thing. Dying in some filthy inn, after being gutted like a fish by some farmer with a sword is quite another.";
         text30 = "Who was it that said that you wouldn\'t go far? Made it all the way to Gaelius\' own quarters, didn\'t you? Died there too, but that\'s a different story and in any case, it beats dying in some ditch or a flea-infested hovel.\n\nHow many people have seen the inside of the palace, not to mention the Lord\'s own quarters? How many have seen the fear on his face? They would probably shit themselves if Gaelius even looked in their direction. When you looked at him - really looked at him, for a second there, he knew and he turned white in an instant. He wasn\'t a lord at that moment, but the lowliest of the low, waiting for you to decide his fate. That moment alone was worth dying for.";
         text31 = "Weakened and tired, you drop your guard for a moment, but a moment is all it takes to put an end to your once promising career as a thief. Your chest explodes with pain and you fall to your knees, gasping for breath, your enemies all but forgotten.\n\nThe guard grins and raises his sword to finish you off. It seems surreal, like a strange dream you can\'t wake up from. You tell him what everyone else says when their time is up - \"wait!\", but the sword flashes down and the world goes dark.";
         text32 = "You fall down, knowing full well that you aren\'t getting up. Your mortal shell, battered and bleeding, has taken you as far as it could and now the exciting journey that\'s been your life is coming to end. Come to think about it, it hasn\'t been that exciting. Come to think about it, you aren\'t even clear what you died for here.\n\nCarrinas set the wheels in motions, started the events that saw both him and you killed. Not a bad company. Of course, he died for something and you died for Linos\' gold - a payment for Carrinas\' death. You barely escaped Teron and thought you\'d be safe in Maadoran, but the ripples from that fateful event kept spreading and you just couldn\'t outrun them.";
         text33 = "It was a good plan up until it went horribly wrong and you ended up dying behind some dumpster, your life flashing before your eyes and reinforcing the notion that it\'s utterly and completely unfair. You\'ve gone against worse odds and lived to brag about it, yet these drunken guards somehow managed to prevail where so many better men failed. How the fuck is it fair? You cough, spitting blood, and doing your best to cling to life, not that your effort\'s going to count for something.";
         text34 = "You dedicate your last moments to Strabos, whom you\'re holding solely responsible for your death. So you lie there, bleeding like a pig and looking at all the blood that used to course through your veins, and cursing Strabos. You\'ve never really believed in curses before, but what do you have to lose now? If it doesn\'t work, you\'re dead anyway. If it does and Strabos\' line will live under a horrible curse for the rest of eternity, well, that\'s something. You\'ve heard something about blood magic before. Well, that\'s gotta be it, right? No shortage of blood in this room, that\'s for sure.\n\nYou gather your strength and yell your curse - powerful, terrible, potent. The blood responds. You feel it! You know it! A dark shadow falls upon you. You turn your head to look at the horrible creature you\'ve conjured and see one of Hamza\'s assassins. Something flashes and your world goes dark.";
         text35 = "You die far from home, surrounded by these squinty-eyed devils. You see nothing, but disdain on their ugly faces. Apparently, they don\'t think that you die like a warrior. Like you give a shit. They argue for a while, ignoring your pleas for water, then nod their heads in agreement. The man next to you grabs you by the hair lifting your head and draws his saber. Fucking savages! This is what you get for trying to bring them some culture...";
         text36 = "When the guards blocked your path, you did what any warrior worth his salt would do - drew your weapon and attempted to show them the error of their ways. Except they had the advantage of numbers and were more skilled than you assumed, which made the error entirely yours and the guards weren\'t shy at all when it came to driving this point home.\n\nWhen you admit defeat by dropping your weapon and collapsing, the guards strip you of anything valuable and throw you off the mountain.";
         text37 = "You knew that you were doomed the moment you stepped foot inside this accursed tower. You tried to fight, but what mortal can defeat a demon - an abomination made of stone and magic? How can you kill that which doesn\'t bleed?\n\nWith a gut-wrenching sound, the demon\'s sword bites deep into your shoulder, slicing through flesh and armor alike. Your knees buckle and you scream, when you feel the coldness spreading through your body - a sure sign of the cursed blade consuming your very soul.\n\nYou beg the demon for a clean death, tears running down your cheeks, then curse him, invoking the holy names of the Gods in an attempt to bind the evil creature, while the demon watches the spectacle with curiosity. Eventually, you run out of steam and drift away. The demon looks at all the blood pooling on the marble floor and goes off to look for something to clean up the mess you made.";
         text38 = "You aren\'t quite sure why you decided to stay. It wasn\'t your fight, but you were already there and one fight is as good as another. No reason to be picky about such things. You did your best and that\'s what counts. Of course, now that you\'re as good as dead - you know that you aren\'t going anywhere with a hole in your stomach and without a leg, it\'s tempting to start revaluating what counts for what. Maybe not throwing your life away, especially when you don\'t have a personal stake there, and living a bit longer is what counts. Sounds like a coward\'s talk, that\'s for sure.\n\nNah, you did the right thing. Never turned down a fight. Lived by that code. Of course, you don\'t get to live long when you have a code like that, but that\'s an entirely different matter.";
         text39 = "Well, look at the bright side - your final resting place will be a tomb. Nowadays, most people get the \'pile\' - dragged off to a pile of rotting carcasses and left for the \'elements\' to work their magic. The lucky ones get a proper hole in the ground, those who deserve no less, who are too good for the pile.\n\nBut you, you get your own fucking tomb. Well, not your own, but a tomb is a tomb, so why split hairs? Lying next to the likes of Darius and whoever was buried there before him - must have been a man of great importance. If only your mama could see you now...";
         text4 = "Agathoth crouches down next to your broken, dying body. He does it in a strange, ape-like manner, his tentacles gliding through your blood pooling on the floor like snakes while he watches you labor for breath.\n\nThe god raises his hands and the palms open up like a starfish\'s mouth, bloodless and jagged. He places the palms on your head, you feel a strange rush of blood and then you feel nothing at all.";

The old crawler stands still, clicking its pincers arhythmically, seemingly indifferent to your presence.\n\nYou take another step and the monster lunges forward, one giant claw brushing your thigh. You feint at the creature\'s defenses but the pincers, swift and well armored, hold you at bay. So absorbed are you in the dance of death that the lash of its tail takes you completely by surprise. The stinger punctures your shoulder like a spear and instantly withdraws, wet with blood and venom. There is no surge of pain from the wound. Instead your left arm falls numb and slack.\n\nKnowing what this means, you charge forward, swinging wildly, but the scorpion is no longer interested in battle and tries to scuttle out of reach. With its defenses briefly lowered, you strike, driving the sword through the helmet-like shell and into its brain. Unfortunately, the brain doesn\'t seem to be where you thought it would be and the enraged scorpion jumps back into action. One pincer severs your femur like a boy breaking a twig and you topple, screaming in pain.\n\nIn your last moment, you see something few men have seen, the tail lashing a second time, and the world goes dark...";

You dodge the first blade and it follows with the other, but the machine is slow and its strikes are predictable. Perhaps this is the result of centuries without maintenance. The thing freezes in place for a moment, adjusting angles and recalculating, then attacks again, slightly faster, but still little more than a nuisance.\n\nHaving established its pattern, you begin to probe for chinks in its armor. After repelling a fourth slow but determined attack, you take a swipe at a foreleg, but your sword rings against what seems to be solid metal. The machine freezes again, invisible gears whirring, and this time attacks with a series of swift and precise strikes. It presses forward at speed now and from a deep slash across your ribs you realize it has suddenly learned to feint. Your opponent is too fast and you quickly go from blocking three of every four strikes, to two of four, to one of four... and the construct freezes once more, gears winding down with a wheeze.\n\nYou\'re covered in blood from many ugly but shallow wounds, as well as a few needing immediate attention, if you are to survive. But you won\'t have to worry about such things anymore.\n\nWhen it next steps forward, the construct moves so swiftly you do not see the forelegs shooting forward until you are already skewered and dragged beneath the lens of its eye socket.

You clutch your dagger, gathering strength for one last attack, but how to kill that which cannot be slain by steel or hand? And if he takes your life now, he takes your soul as well.\n\nYour enemy\'s visage swims before you as he advances, and he appears bent from the exertion and two deep wounds, frail and almost human, a final magical feint to distract you, but you have made your choice.

Truth to be told, you had zero intentions of fighting either because you knew how it would turn out. You were still thinking about it when you took Hamza to the palace, mulling it over and over, but when it came to it, it was a coin toss.\n\nYou picked your side and did your best, like you were supposed to, but it didn\'t do you any good because you didn\'t pick the winning side.

The man closest to you goes down and another takes his place, while twenty more wait their turns. It\'s kill and be killed.\n\nA thrown spear hums past your ear to hit one of your brethren behind with a meaty thunk. Whether he was slain then or fought on you will never know. The enemy before you is hacking at your shield and screaming; saliva and splinters fly everywhere. You sink your axe to the haft in his forehead, work it lose with a quick sawing motion and raise your shield again. Two bolts from two different marksmen hit it at once, one penetrating and fixing the shield to your arm.\n\nAn enemy on your left, focused on fighting one of your comrades, has left his right side exposed. Your axe swings down to chop into his leg. A hammer blow from your exposed right side sets your helmet ringing and you\'re on the ground. The helmet did its job - instead of being dead, you\'re only nearly dead. Blinded by pain, you clench your teeth for the killing strike, but your assailant has already moved past. In the fierce melee, there is no time to waste on a downed enemy.\n\nYou\'ve lost your axe, so you wrest a sword from a headless corpse. Instinct makes you look up from your crouch at a towering figure wielding a two-hander. A quick jab between the legs and he falls backwards, giving you just enough room to get to your feet and raise what\'s left of your shield to ward off the next attack.\n\nLike a striking snake, a spear sneaks under the shield, biting you deep, then withdraws. Once again you go down, puzzled this time. Your ears are still ringing from the hammer blow.\n\nYou cast around for the spearman, hoping to sell your life a little more dear, and spy a pale boy, not even a teenager, hiding behind a burly, bearded man. His father? The kid darts out to stab another legionary, yelling excitedly. You throw your sword at him, praying for a miracle, but you\'ve already witnessed the only miracle on offer today, that you lived this long.

Rules or no rules, the Guards were bound to hit back. They torched the guild to flash you out, forcing you to fight them out in the open.\n\nWell, you did your part. The bastards wanted a fight, so you gave it to them. Unfortunately, there is only so much fight you can give to four heavily armoured Imperial Guards. You could have taken two Guards. Maybe three.\n\nYou\'re still alive, when the Guards return and start building some sort of \"don\'t fuck with us\" totem. Fucking savages. You see Neleos\' head on a spike. Doesn\'t look so happy now, does he? Then you see a man standing over you, raising a two hander over his head. The flash of the blade is the last thing you see.\n";
         text7 = "You clutch the wound in the vain hope that you can staunch the blood seeping out of your body. The blood flows through your fingers as you drop down on your knees. You know it\'s a bad sign when you don\'t feel much pain. It doesn\'t look like you\'re coming back from this one. Oh well.\n\nThere\'s no use crying over spilt blood now; you always knew that it was a suicide mission. Everyone has to die some day and as far as deaths go, it\'s hard to top this one. You were part of a crew that didn\'t take shit from anybody, not even from the Imperial Guards. Next time they think about fucking with the Boatmen, they\'ll think twice, that\'s for sure. \n\nYour eyelids feel heavy. You close your eyes for just a moment, but never open them again.\n";
         text8 = "You catch a sword thrust and time slows down to a crawl. You fall down, staring into nothingness. You absent-mindedly reflect on the fact that for reasons you barely understand, all the promise that your life once held results in you dying, dressed as a raider. \n\nIn death, your body suffers as many indignities as it did in life. It\'s displayed proudly as a proof that the threat of the raiders has been dealt with and that the likes of you will never again terrorize this peaceful town. Those who knew you know better than to question the official story openly. So, as a lesson to all, your body is left to rot on a cross.\n";
         text9 = "When they sent your unit to take that tower, you knew that some of your men wouldn\'t be coming back. You just never believed that you would be one of them. To be fair, nobody ever does. It\'s part of the game and nobody plays to lose. You roll the dice and hope for the best. Day after day, you\'re granted a free pass and then - out of the blue - your number\'s up and the game is over. It\'s your turn to be the one that doesn\'t come back. \n\nYou don\'t believe it at first. Plenty of people have taken a blade through the guts and survived. Determined to stay alive until a doc is sent in to patch up the wounded, you crawl away from the fight. It\'s only when you glance back and see a trail of blood and intestines that you realize you\'re beyond help, that today\'s your turn. You die before the fight is over.  \n";
