This Kingdom grew and prospered, and these Men knew not war or suffering for they were humble and obedient to the laws of the Gods.\n\nBut Those Who Dwell in the Void were envious. Of Whispers and Lies did they build a great army, and brought War upon the Kingdom of Men. It was a war like no other, where Gods fought amongst Men.\n\nTerrible weapons reduced the great cities to cinders and fertile lands to desert, and the Gods were slain. In the Dark Age which followed, Brother turned against Brother and without the guidance of Gods, Men were cast low, becoming no better than beasts.\n\nHope was lost until a wise few at last turned aside from Whispers and Lies. Through their prayer and sacrifice the One <God/Goddess> was reborn in a mortal vessel. Birthed into our plane, <He/She> shed the chrysalis of <His/Her> mortal form in place of a more fitting body, for all things serve the One <God/Goddess>, even flesh itself.\n\n\"Behold,\" <He/She> said, \"for I am Thy <God/Goddess>. Kneel before me and I will rule over you.\" But the Shadow of the Void yet lay upon much of the world, and those who were more beasts than men rose up against <Him/Her>.";

They brought news that the beast-men had been extinguished and only the humble and obedient remained, and it pleased <God/Goddess> to hear this.\n\n<God/Goddess> ordered them to raise up a Temple in praise to <Him/Her> and a new city around it. <He/She> ordered the ruins both old and recent destroyed, for they were infected with the Whispers and Lies of Those Who Dwell in the Void, and so eradicated the ancient poison that turns Men into beasts.\n\nAs in the first days, the city grew and prospered. When the servants of the One <God/Goddess> grew too numerous for <His/Her> city, <God/Goddess> chose the three wisest of his High Priests and ordered them each to build a new city, where they would rule in <His/Her> name and all would follow <His/Her> Laws...";
