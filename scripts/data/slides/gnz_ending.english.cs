These events promise a new renaissance for the profession of loremaster. Already those dusty merchants of history, half-truths and lies are walking more slowly, heads bowed with profound thought.

That any act of war, however ruthless, could shock the jaded echelons of the empire is a surprise in itself.\n\nThe massacre of so many legionnaires and the death of Dux Paullus weaken the Imperial Guards but it seems that no blow, however severe, can undo them.
