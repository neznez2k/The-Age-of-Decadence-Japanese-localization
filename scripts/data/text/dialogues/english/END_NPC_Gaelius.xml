“But first, I have a special task for you. There are stories of a certain pre-War temple. Both Antidas and Meru tried to find it. While Meru is dead, his followers are still around. If they find it first, nothing good will come out of it.

“I want you to find the temple and destroy it. I don't want any witnesses, so this task is for you and you alone. As far as everyone's concerned, this temple is nothing but a figment of Meru's imagination. It has never existed.”</npc_text>
