      <npc_text>Linos the Skull owed his nickname to his appearance, and his appearance to the decades of service to the merchants guild. It was that service that changed an enthusiastic youth with blue eyes and wavy auburn hair into a dispassionate old man with a bald head and cold, almost colorless eyes sitting deep within the dark sockets. Business to Linos was a board game. He moved pieces and executed strategies, without taking any "human element" into consideration. A good opportunity shouldn't be missed solely because some people were standing in the way.

"I can't believe that Gracius dared to come to Teron after all. That bastard. It's an insult."</npc_text>

      <npc_text>In the halcyon days of the Empire, the Emperor commanded his own guard. Apart from their regular duties of protection for the Emperor, they were trained as experts in infiltration and assassination. Many political and military opponents would meet with unexplainable misfortune or death in the rapture of night, ensuring the long-standing stability of the Empire. After the fall, without a master to serve, the guard disbanded into the chaos of the fallen empire. Once outside they found that even as the world lay in ruins, their peacekeeping services were in great demand. An Assassins' Order was established that later bore the proud name of the Regiment – the Boatmen of Styx.

You enter the Boatmen of Styx guild. The business-like nature of the establishment is very clear. The hall is lacking any decoration or flamboyance and the patrons are mostly silent. There are no guards anywhere in the room.</npc_text>

      <npc_text>Neleos, the guildmaster of Teron's assassins, always smiled. He smiled when he talked to people, as if he was just told a good joke, and he smiled when he had to kill, which, in his mind, was a joke life played on his victims. Since the dead are good at keeping secrets, few people thought of Neleos as an assassin, and the general consensus was that Neleos was strictly an administrator of the guild, rather than someone who killed for a living.
