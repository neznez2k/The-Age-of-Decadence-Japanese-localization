When you sign up, you trade in your worry and your uncertain future for a sword and shiny armor and everything else that comes with it. From that point on you never go hungry again, nor will you need for anything – including direction. You’ll be well fed, looked after, and told what to do.

“I joined when I was a young lad, working on my father’s farm along with my brothers. Now that’s a hard life, full of uncertainties. I signed up with the Guards the first chance I got and never looked back. My brothers are long dead, the farm’s gone, but I’m still around.”</npc_text>

Before you know it, everyone was coming to see me to stitch their sorry hides. I always did it nice and clean. Knew which herbs to use too. Soon, the legatus, may he rest in peace now, came to see me work and told me that from that point on my job was to stitch and mend. Traded the sword for a needle, you might say.”</npc_text>

      <npc_text>The old man looks at you again to make sure you’re serious, then shrugs.

“Suppose you give an order and your men refuse to do it. What are you gonna do? Give them a talking to? Chain them? Kill them all? No. You split them in groups of ten and let them draw lots. The poor bastard who draws the lucky one is killed and his brethren are the ones who have to do the killing.

“If an entire cohort fucks up, it might take a while as that’s what, fifty people to kill? Well, this way you lose only ten percent of your soldiers, but the rest will do whatever it takes to avoid drawing lots again and butchering their own.”</npc_text>

      <npc_text>When it comes to healing, the old man sticks with three basic techniques: cutting, burning, and stitching. Clearly, what was good for the cavemen is good enough for him. Occasionally, he spits out something what looks like chewing tobacco and shoves it in the wound, saying that a bit of herb will do the body good.

In the end he manages to stop the bleeding without causing any permanent damage or disfigurement and patch up your wounds. If you didn't know any better, you'd think you're as good as new.</npc_text>
