      <npc_text>You enter the ruined tower. It was destroyed during the war, twice rebuilt and twice fallen. Instead of blaming hasty craftsmanship and inferior building materials, the spirits of those who died there during the war were held accountable. The tower was said to be cursed and left to squatters and beggars.

Several squatters, accustomed to people coming and going, look at you without any interest. The place is practically empty, save for piles of rubble and trash. An unusually large rat is roasted whole over an open fire, filling the tower with a revolting aroma. The squatters don't seem to mind it.

There is a hatch leading into the tower's cellar.</npc_text>
