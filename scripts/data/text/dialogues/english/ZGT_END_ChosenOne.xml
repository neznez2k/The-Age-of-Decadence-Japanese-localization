      <npc_text>Faelan’s gaze awakens something deep within you. Slowly, it rises to surface, like a kraken disturbed by a foolish fisherman. Without any regard for your sanity, this alien presence assumes control, looking at Faelan with curiosity.

His smile disappears, replaced by the look of raw terror in his eyes. You feel invisible tendrils reaching toward Faelan and Meru. The first tendril makes contact and Faelan screams.</npc_text>

      <npc_text>Satisfied, Agathoth withdraws, handing the reins back to you. Meru is lying on the floor, dead. Faelan seems to be in shock.

“I... I can’t see,” he says strangely, as if refusing to believe what just happened. He lost more than his eyesight, his very strength and power that made him fear no man has been ripped away from him.</npc_text>

      <npc_text>You pray for help and guidance while you wait, but Agathoth remains silent. Perhaps, your body is too weak to channel the 'divine spirit' again before recovering. Perhaps, Agathoth's attention is occupied elsewhere. Either way, you're on your own now.

Inquisitor Varro shows up first, followed by Athanasius and Nabupolassar, the prophet. Lord Darganus arrives with an armed escort. Meru's death is an opportunity and he won't shed any tears. The Second Acolyte appears to be in a mournful mood but he's probably already rehearsing the coronation speech in his mind.

Feng hobbles in last. Cautious as ever. He'd gladly send you to the cross but not before he's certain that his vote won't backfire.

You'd need at least four votes to win.</npc_text>

      <npc_text>“Clearly, it’s a matter for the Inquisition,” Varro says quickly. “A case of divine intervention of such magnitude must be thoroughly investigated until no doubt remains. Until then –”

“Until then I’ll assume the duties of the First Acolyte,” interrupts the Second Acolyte. “Our flock needs a shepherd more than ever in these troubling times,” he casts a glance toward you.

“Let’s not be hasty here,” says Athanasius, making it clear that he won’t be sidelined.</npc_text>
