      <npc_text>Paullus’ men approach the Aurelians in close formation and their new allies greet them with cheers, as what seemed a hopeless slog suddenly has the look of a triumph. You alone, knowing what is to come, recognize the tension in the approaching soldiers. Nowhere do you see a smile or a friendly wave, or an iota of slackened discipline.

In grim silence, Paullus’ highest officer and bodyguards step into the Aurelian command tent, and moments later the charade ends in blood.

With no more emotion than a butcher rendering a calf, the interlopers fall on their victims without mercy. By the time the defenders manage to assemble a formation, half of their men have been incapacitated or slain. In the instant when it appears that the Aurelians may in spite of everything rally, the sound of a distant gong signals the opening of Ganezzar’s main gates. Crassus’ troops push forward in a wave, driving the remaining Aurelian forces ahead of them into the hills.

The siege is broken.</npc_text>

      <npc_text>Carrinas’ legionaries keep up the charade until the very last moment. The Aurelian soldiers, believing them to be the vanguard of the army, respond with cheers, but their enthusiasm turns to ragged shouts of warning as the Imperial Guards level their weapons and charge. Like a spear through a paper screen, the Imperial Guards burst through the defenders’ ranks to overrun the command tent.

In that same moment, the sound of a distant gong signals the opening of Ganezzar’s main gates and Crassus’ troops spill out, adding to chaos and confusion. By the time the Aurelians manage to assemble a defensive line, half of their men have been incapacitated or slain and soon the remainder are broken. Although few of Carrinas’ legionaries are still standing and the bodies of Meru’s zealots litter the ground, their sacrifice hasn’t been in vain. The Aurelian forces are devastated, and with no prospect of reinforcements they are compelled to withdraw.

Crassus’ legatus, oblivious to the blood covering the left side of his face and running down his neck, does not look to you but simply nods once, satisfied.

The siege is broken.</npc_text>

      <npc_text>In the hour before dawn, the Sellsword Legion rises from the hills like shadows silently come to life. The Aurelian watchmen must at some point have grown lazy, for no alarm sounds as the mercenaries raise their voices in a single terrifying shriek and rush the besiegers’ camp from all sides. Chaos ensues, with bitter curses, the clashing of blades, and ripping of canvas punctuated by the deep thump of bombs detonating, killing men from both sides. The mercenaries are wild-eyed from ingesting mushrooms, or simply bloodlust, and counter the discipline of their foes with a reckless disregard for their own lives.

When it becomes clear that the sellswords are killing at least as many as they are losing, Ganezzar’s main gates yawn wide, Crassus’ troops pour out, and confusion becomes havoc. By the time the Aurelians manage to assemble a defensive line, half of their men have been incapacitated or slain and soon the remainder are broken. The corpses of the sellswords and Meru’s zealots lay thick on the ground, but their sacrifice hasn’t been in vain. Though they dealt as much death as anyone could expect, the Aurelian forces are devastated, and with no prospect of reinforcements they are compelled to withdraw.

As you regard this grim shambles, one of the mercenaries is still whooping and leaping about, thrusting his spear at invisible enemies, until at the end of one particularly wild stagger he falls full on the blade of a sword, wedged point upward between two corpses.

The siege is broken.</npc_text>

Meru and his cadre observe stone-faced from the barbican above the gate. If anyone is thinking that perhaps Meru should apply to his gods for help, he wisely keeps this counsel to himself.

Paullus sends a messenger to invite Meru to discuss terms, and it appears you are in for a long siege.</npc_text>

      <npc_text>The attack before sunrise the following day is completely unanticipated, ladders of a type you had never seen before springing up like weeds all along the wall. They were assembled during the night from shorter sections hidden beneath the boards of Paullus’ wagons. Within minutes, enemy soldiers swarm the battlements.

When the gates are bashed open, you know the city is lost. The defenders fight with unparalleled zeal, but learn to their dismay that no amount of belief will shield a man from the discipline of a hardened fighter.

Paullus sets the survivors to clearing a path through the bodies in the street, and the way to the castle is open.

Ganezzar has fallen.</npc_text>

      <npc_text>The attack starts before sunrise the following day. Ladders spring up like weeds along the walls and balistae send off a barrage of missiles, most breaking off harmlessly against the walls. Within minutes, enemy soldiers swarm the battlements.

When the gates are bashed open, you know the city is lost. The defenders fight with unparalleled zeal, but learn to their dismay that no amount of belief will shield a man from the discipline of a hardened fighter.

Ganezzar has fallen.</npc_text>

      <npc_text>This is the moment when two contingents of Ordu archers appear on the hills, while a third group similarly arises like ghosts from the forest floor to attack the Guards from the rear, forcing them to fall back to the only logical position, higher ground and the castle gate. However, a group of previously unseen Aurelian reserves, like the third consecutive roll of double skulls in a game of dice, appears to block the gate, locking their shields against the Guards’ last hope.</npc_text>

      <npc_text>The Aurelians expend little effort in this fight, grimly and quietly maintaining the line as a black cloud of arrow shafts, implacable as a storm front, sweeps over the Imperial Guards, leaving the remaining soldiers, dragged back from the cusp of victory, to be ground beneath the boots of the Ordu. A few of the Guard’s hardest, those whose discipline does not waiver in their cups, nor asleep, nor even in bed with a woman, form a phalanx and push back against the Ordu, but one of their master archers, having saved his last arrow for just this purpose, tracks Paullus in the formation, and puts it through his eye. The leader’s fall is truly the end. The jaws of the trap close. There are no survivors.</npc_text>
