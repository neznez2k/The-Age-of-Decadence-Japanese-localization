      <npc_text>Accompanied by two centurions, the Aurelian Legatus meets you at a ‘neutral’ spot between the Aurelian camp and the city walls. Involuntary, he glances up, at the gravity-defying fortress hovering in the air next to the castle, then looks at you.

“If you think it changes anything –” says the Legatus, starting a well-rehearsed speech aimed to convince you that the arrival of the ship had no effect on his troops' morale.</npc_text>

Sadly, the shields don’t seem to be working, but it’s not like your crossbows and ballistae can do any real damage. The firing systems are in a fairly good shape though. The aim’s a bit off but with Hellfyre it’s not that big of an issue.”</text>
