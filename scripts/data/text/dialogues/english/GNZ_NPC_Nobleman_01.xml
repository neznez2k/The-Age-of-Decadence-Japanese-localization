      <npc_text>“My take on it is that at first the Crassus lords didn’t want a city. They wanted a remote castle reachable only by air but at some point supplying the castle and the growing number of retainers had become too expensive.

“That’s when they built the cascading levels and the first stairways, and opened the lands around the hill for farming. When the farmers came, they settled at the foot of the hill. So the noble families were near the castle, at the top where they belong, the plebs at the bottom, and the equestrians in the middle. A perfect natural order.”</npc_text>
