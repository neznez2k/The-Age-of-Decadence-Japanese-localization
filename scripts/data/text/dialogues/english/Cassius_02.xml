"There came a great disturbance in the town of Lakia by the Nazvian Sea, with confusion and flight. [...]And all the people fled from the ships of the kingdom of Q'antaar, which had crossed the sea, inflicting every kind of punishment upon the people of Lakia. [...]The Imperial army, being blessed and varying in design, fell upon the enemy. Slain were the men, their ships set aflame, the women taken into bondage...

"A single year did come to pass, and again a great number of Q'antaari ships crossed the sea. The ships carried an army larger than had ever been witnessed, and never had the Words of Power afforded such benefit to a coming invasion."</npc_text>

      <npc_text>"Actually, I wrote a tractate on the Qantari's allies twelve years ago, when Lord Meru was looking for a new loremaster. The allies, as you call them, had a number of different names, which reflects how little we know about them. Most texts we have now have been written long after the events in question. They reflect beliefs of those who wrote them.

"Some wanted to believe in higher powers and thought our allies to be long forgotten gods, finally returning to aid their children in the hour of need. Others believed – quite arrogantly, I might add - that the allies were kings of the otherworldly realms, peers of the Emperor.

"Even the names are spelled in so many different ways that it's almost impossible to tell what the original names were. The one we call Thor-Agoth, for example, was originally referred to as Tor-Athagoth and Thoragoth. Even the very nature of the High Lords is debatable.

"Many accounts describe the four Qantari Gods as terrifying beast-like creatures. For example, there are several different accounts of the battle of Estios all claiming the same thing: Ull-Xerath rose from the deep and attacked the legions of General Kesion, slaughtering over a thousand soldiers before the magi forced him to retreat."</npc_text>

      <npc_text>"Have you ever read Ammanas?" Cassius smiles and starts reciting:

"In the battle of Zaghoss Lord Hezbenus sent forth his five beasts in advance of the phalanx. Neither the Galatians themselves nor their horses had previously seen such beasts, and they were so confused by the unexpected sight, that they turned and fled in a disorderly route before they were within bowshot. The beasts ploughed through the remaining Galatians legionaries with a devastating effect.

"The slowly marching beasts, frightful with their wrinkled bodies, were a hideous spectacle, dreadful beyond every form of horror, as I have often declared."

"Do you know what these hideous beasts were? Elephants. So, take what you read with a grain of salt."</npc_text>

This artefact reminds me of the power tubes, which begs the question - what does it do that the tubes can't? Unless the power it stores is somehow unique and can be recognized by the receiving device, which would make it, well, a key.

One day, Ibn Hadad meditated with a certain purpose in mind – he was seeking a way to gain power over demons, a way to have them delivered into his hands so that he might question them.

"Eventually the sacred geometry he sought was revealed to him. Ibn Hadad ordered his brothers to prepare the ground and draw a large seal and inscribe the words of power within it. When they completed their work, a man appeared in the circle of the seal."</npc_text>

"So ask me not many things, for thy kingdom after a little time is to be disrupted, and thy glory is but for a season. And short will be thy tyranny over us, and then we shall have free range over mankind, so as that they shall revere us as if we were gods, not knowing, men that they are, the words of power over us."

"Ibn Hadad dismissed his brothers and addressed the demon as follows: "By the seal that binds your power, which is infinitely above mine, because you know what is going on in the higher as well as in the lower spheres, I order you to reveal all that you know to me."</npc_text>

"No," insisted Ibn Hadad, "nothing will induce me to abstain from increasing my knowledge, for it is that, and not silver or gold, that I have set my heart upon."

"If my advice is to no purpose," said the demon, "I will proceed to open for thee the hidden secrets, but it will be necessary to release me from the chain thou hast put round me when I was made captive."</npc_text>

Scarcely had he done so, when a thunder clap passed through the air, which made the whole place vibrate. At the same moment the demon seemed to have grown into a terrible giant, his eyes looked like two great, gleaming fires and his arms extended to enormous proportions – looking as though they would catch hold of the extreme ends of the earth.

"Ibn Hadad trembled at the sight, his heart seemed to stand still from terror, and he was about to call for help; but his whole body was paralysed, his tongue refused its duty, and in the midst of this he was seized by the demon by arm and neck and thrown into the air, and he became senseless."</npc_text>

"I've heard several retellings of this story. In one, Ibn Hadad had a magic ring with which he defeated the demon. In another, the demon took all his powers and Ibn Hadad went on a quest to gain them back and learned the demon's name, which was Baalzurath, to gain power over him.

Maybe it's a cautionary tale where the demon represents the danger of power that a mere man wasn't meant to understand. Maybe it's a distorted account of a rather mundane event.
