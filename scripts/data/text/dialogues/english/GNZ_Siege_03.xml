      <npc_text>Paullus’ men approach the Aurelians in close formation and their new allies greet them with cheers, as what seemed a hopeless slog suddenly has the look of a triumph. You alone, knowing what is to come, recognize the tension in the approaching soldiers. Nowhere do you see a smile or a friendly wave, or an iota of slackened discipline.

In grim silence, Paullus' highest officer and bodyguards step into the Aurelian command tent, and moments later the charade ends in blood.

With no more emotion than a butcher rendering a calf, the interlopers fall on their victims without mercy. By the time the defenders manage to assemble a formation, half of their men have been incapacitated or slain. In the instant when it appears that the Aurelians may in spite of everything rally, the sound of a distant gong signals the opening of Ganezzar’s main gates. Crassus’ troops push forward in a wave, driving the remaining Aurelian forces ahead of them into the hills.

The siege is broken.</npc_text>
