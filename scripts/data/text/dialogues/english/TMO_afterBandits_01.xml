      <npc_text>Sitting in the shadow of the mountain, the Aurelian outpost is protected from prying eyes by a tall, wooden palisade that circles it. Judging by a dead guard slumped over the watchtower's balcony, prying eyes weren't the outpost garrison's biggest problem. When you get closer, you see half a dozen dead bodies strewn around the entrance. Esbenus, the raiders' leader, is sitting on the ground in front of a small barricade. He's covered in blood, but it's hard to say how much of it is his own.

"Some diggers are still alive," he says tiredly. "Holed up inside the tunnel."</npc_text>

"It went better than I expected," says Dellar. "The diggers saw the attack. They are on their way to Lord Gaelius, to inform him that an army of raiders has descended upon the ill-defended outpost, slaughtered the Aurelian legionaries, and would have killed the poor diggers too, if not for the Daratan forces who, unfortunately, have arrived too late to save their noble brethren.

"You did well, &lt;charname&gt;. Without lifting a sword you've solved quite a few of our problems. Tiberius is free. The Aurelian forces are dead. The raiders are dead. The mine is ours. Not that it's doing us any good at the moment, but still...
