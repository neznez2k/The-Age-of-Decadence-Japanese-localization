      <npc_text>You have arrived at the giant crater known as the Abyss. At least two miles across, it is flanked by the ruins of the ancient city, the walls standing like crumbling sentinels over the pit. A restless grey fog cloaks the bottom of the defile, effectively concealing the horrors which undoubtedly lie within.

You aren’t alone. As you approach, you see the usual crowd gathered. Places of destruction and mystery always attract tourists, and with them the soothsayers and hawkers who make a living selling whatever they desire, from old world trinkets got up like artefacts, to curses purporting to channel the dark energies of the Abyss, to that ever popular standby, kebabs. The raucous cries you associate with bartering are however unusually subdued and flat, like those of a group of children playing at the edge of a graveyard, each attempting to convince his neighbour – and more so, himself – of his bravery.</npc_text>
