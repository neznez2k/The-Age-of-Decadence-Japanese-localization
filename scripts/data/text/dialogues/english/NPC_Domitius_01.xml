      <npc_text>“Well, I suppose it’s not really a secret. According to the map, the temple is somewhere north-east from Teron, but the map hasn’t been drawn to scale, so it’s almost impossible to pinpoint the exact location. What’s worse is the map’s been drawn before the war, so many places the map refers to are no longer there.

“There were reports of a buried temple east of Maadoran, so that’s where we started. We set up camps and started combing the desert, looking for the signs of the temple. The problem is the desert never stays the same. Wind constantly shifts the sands, making dunes and moving them at will. Entire towns have been known to disappear under the shifting sands, so looking for a buried temple in a desert is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Still, we were optimistic, but that’s when the attacks came.”</npc_text>

We lowered several men down there and sent them to look for a way up, but they didn’t return. Then we split our group in two, one went north to look for a way to cross the river, the other went south.

“I was with the group that went north. We didn’t find a way across but we found something far more interesting – a temple carved into the face of a mountain. At first we even thought we'd found the temple, that the gods led us to it.”</npc_text>
