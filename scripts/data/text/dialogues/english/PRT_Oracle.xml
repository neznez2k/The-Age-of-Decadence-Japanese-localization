      <npc_text>“I thank you for your intervention, traveler. It's always pleasing to see wickedness punished and virtue rewarded. What brought you here?” asks the Oracle – an ancient, wizened man with a deeply lined face.

He looks at you, first with his good eye, then with the empty socket that would be his left. It’s a well-practiced movement that makes you feel as if the dead socket is looking into your very soul.</npc_text>

      <npc_text>The Oracle – an ancient, wizened man with a deeply lined face – slowly gets up when you approach and looks at you, first with his good eye, then with the empty socket that would be his left. It’s a well-practiced movement that makes you feel as if the dead socket is looking into your very soul. The other men and women of the group watch intently from various relaxed positions around you.

“What do you seek here, traveler?” he asks.</npc_text>

      <npc_text>The bell's high pitched note rings out long and clear against the vast silence around you. That perfect sound steadily diminishes until only a pregnant tension hangs in the air. After several seconds of intense silence the Oracle begins to chant softly and slowly. The words, if that is what they are, sound as gibberish to you.

He begins to rock in time with the cadence of his chant, gradually increasing speed. At one point you are certain you hear your name amongst the twisted syllables but it is quickly carried away by the rapid flow of the chant.

The Oracle’s one eye rolls back until nothing but the white is visible and he begins to shake violently. The chanting and tremors reach a sudden apex, then ... stop suddenly and completely as the old man flicks a handful of fine dust into the air from a pouch at his side. His eye flits forward and studies the cloud of silt as it lazily settles to the ground. The muffled gasps and exhalations of the acolytes ripple around you.

Without focusing on you he calmly speaks, “The gods attend us. Put forth your query...”</npc_text>

      <npc_text>“No. I help them see the truth. Being surrounded by a world such as this, what do they think if they travel to see me and find an old man sitting without pomp or fanfare on a bare stone in the Waste? The arch is a holy site but they do not know that. And if I share with them the gods’ wisdom, as if in conversation with a neighbor at the tavern, wouldn’t they doubt the validity of my claims? Simple people want to believe that petitioning the gods is a life changing event. Old-man-on-rock-speaking-sagely does not look like the genuine article to them. So I give them a little of what they want so that they will receive what they need.”</npc_text>

      <npc_text>“...true. When we go to the gods for answers, they will answer. Sometimes it is difficult to hear them. It has taken me many years of meditation to hear their guidance. Still yet, it is not always easy. Their words swirl within us, in a dust storm of our own doubts, aspirations, and pride. But with focus one can bring the divine words to the fore and see them for what they are.”</npc_text>

      <npc_text>“I admit, it is not always easy. When you live your whole life communing with the gods and are always left guessing at their answers...even a great Oracle can feel lost. It shames me to admit it.”

He stares wistfully into the distance. “I think in the old days it was easier. The gods spoke and we heard with our ears, not our hearts. But I keep faith and do my best to tell others what I believe the gods are saying.”</npc_text>

      <npc_text>“Fear of what? Starvation? We work hard to keep a modest crop. We use what little money we receive for buying basics from the rare traveling merchant. Or we occasionally make a visit to town for simple supplies. As you can probably guess our meals are meager but sufficient.

“Raiders? There’s hardly enough food or material value here to make it worth it for most raiders. It does happen though. They might take part of us as slaves. They may not. I’m the twenty sixth Oracle in four hundred years. Some of us even manage to die of old age, or so it is said. Some of us are taken. But what can we do? We are not warriors and we cannot leave our vigil. It is our duty to keep the holy ground and watch for the gods. Just as the soldier marches to battle knowing he may pay with his life, so do we stand watch at our post.”</npc_text>
