      <npc_text>“Excellent choice,” says the man in a patronizing manner, as if being pleasantly surprised by an out-of-towner’s acumen.

“Rule number one – stay away from the Slums. If the city were a hill, then the Slums would be at the very bottom of it, the final destination of all the shit that slowly flows downhill, from one district to another. The guards stay away from the Slums and so should you, if you have any common sense.

“The only ‘law’ there is the thieves’ guild and it’s a very simple law. If you’re one of them, nobody fucks with you. If you aren’t, you are on your own, which usually means good as dead.”</npc_text>

“Besides, he has too many of his own problems to worry about anything else. The palace district is a nest of vipers. You see, when the Empire fell, most nobles fled to Maadoran. Nobody wanted to go to two-bit towns like Teron or Cippur. Ganezzar? It was not for everyone even before Meru went mad.

“So, as I was saying, most nobles fled to Maadoran, and by most, I mean several Houses with their guards and retainers. Oh, it was bloody! House Aurelian – one of the late arrivals – managed to come out on top, which means that many families ended up at the bottom. Still living comfortably, mind you, but what’s comfort for you or me is utter humiliation for the likes of them.”</npc_text>

      <npc_text>“We have five districts, but you should limit your stay to the Trade and Arena districts. Trust me, you have no business in the other three, but since you paid me, I’m going to cover them in my tour to give you a proper perspective.

“At the top of the pyramid is the Palace district, named after – you guessed it – the palace. That’s where the noble-born live, if they have the money to afford it. It’s nice, clean, and crawling with guards.

“You steal a purse in the Arena district and all you’re going to get for your trouble is a beating. You even look at a purse in the Palace district and the guards will chop off your arm before you can blink, just to be safe. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. Life isn’t a picnic even when you have two hands, but if you’re down to one, it becomes downright unbearable.”</npc_text>

      <npc_text>“Then you have the Trade district, home to the merchants’ guild, which pays a fortune in levies and keeps the district on the upper end of the scale. You see that golden dome in the distance? That’s the Commercium, which is kind of fitting. Maadoran used to be known as the City of Three Temples a long, long time ago. The Commercium bought one, the thieves took another, and the Abyss claimed the third. So, now we’re the city of two temples: one houses the merchants’ guild, the other – the thieves’ guild. What can I tell you? It’s the sign of times.

“The Trade district is for tradesmen, moneylenders, and impoverished nobles. If you’re doing well, that’s where you settle and consider yourself lucky.”</npc_text>
