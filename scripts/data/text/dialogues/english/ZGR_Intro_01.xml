      <npc_text>The temple. At last, the temple. You stand in awe of what once was a magnificent complex, a sprawling group of structures the size of Teron, dominated at its heart by the Great Ziggurat. Though time has reduced the walls and smaller buildings to little more than rubble and dust, the ziggurat has resisted the elements. The shifting sands have drifted high on its steps and hungry vines have climbed its surface here and there, but the cracks on its outer shell are superficial. Its presence is like that of a solitary mountain, conveying agelessness and endless patience, seeming content to wait, though for what you do not know.</npc_text>
