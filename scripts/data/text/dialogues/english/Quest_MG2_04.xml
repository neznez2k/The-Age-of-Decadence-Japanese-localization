      <npc_text>"Have you heard the news yet? It was a very busy night. Commander Carrinas was assassinated. The Guards didn't take it well. They stormed the assassins' guild and burned it down, but didn't finish the job. Neleos and a few survivors infiltrated the barracks in the middle of the night and killed everyone in their path. None of them has made it out alive, unfortunately. As for the Imperial Guards, while I would have settled for less, Neleos' final gesture has presented us with an opportunity to deal with the Guards once and for all.

We can't let them rebuild – this much is clear. We can force the remaining Guards to join House Daratan, but I'm afraid to make Antidas too strong and thus too hard to control. Alternatively, we can convince Antidas to finish them off, but it's a waste of resources. Let's make it your call, &lt;charname&gt;."</npc_text>

      <npc_text>"For the same reason we employ mercenary companies. Money is hard to make, but easy to lose; one must always be aware of potential threats. The biggest threat is always the Lords, for they can take everything in the blink of an eye. They could drown us in levies. Pay for this right, pay for that privilege, and before you know it, our profits are diverted to Antidas' treasury. They can seize our assets, claiming that we've conspired with the enemy. Considering that we do business with House Aurelian, it won't be a hard sell.

House Daratan is broke. While I'm sure Antidas will think twice before taking from us, if we leave him no choice, he'll do what he has to – as any man would. Only unlike any other man, he can do quite a lot and get away with it, simply because his blood is blue and ours peasant-red."</npc_text>
