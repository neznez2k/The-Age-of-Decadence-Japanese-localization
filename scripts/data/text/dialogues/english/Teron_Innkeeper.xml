His legs were broken and he wasn't making much sense. Probably driven mad by pain and thirst. He claimed that he fell down some shaft in the middle of nowhere.

"One minute he's walking and the next he's lying down at the bottom with his legs broken. He saw some passage and crawled through until he hit a metal door. He couldn't open it so he crawled back and managed to climb out somehow. The caravan picked him up a few days later.

"When he told the story, some fools decided to drop everything and head out into the wasteland. Of course, they didn't find a shaft or a magic door, but they did run into some raiders on their way back. Four men ended up dead because some fool told them a story."</npc_text>
